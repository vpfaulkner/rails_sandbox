# Rails Sandbox

_Because conventions are hard to remember..._

[rails-sandbox.com](http://rails-sandbox.com)

Open source app to allow Rails developers to quickly see conventional Rails code based on resource design. In other words, you enter a resource named User with a namepspace of Admin and quickly see what the controller, model, routes file, etc. should look like.

I designed this because I found myself constantly having to Google for the standard Rails conventional code. I am committed to convention over configuration but think that sticking to conventions requires more discipline than you might think. I hope that this app will help Rails developers, particularly new developers, stick to these conventions and write better code.
